# Most intriguing design features: 
### Emoji Calendar: 
Our interactive calendar displays an emoji for each day, offering a quick and emotive snapshot of the user's mood history, promoting frequent use and personal reflection. Beneath the calendar, daily inspirational quotes are dynamically displayed, fetched via an API integration, enriching the user's daily interaction. For journal updates, users can easily update their journal by clicking on a prominent emoji face in the main page to add an entry for today, or by selecting specific dates on the calendar. Users can also effortlessly navigate and search past entries by searching past months. 
### Journal System: 
The journaling system offers a design that is both simple and comprehensive, enabling users to intuitively record their mood with emojis, upload photos, and take notes. All data stored in a specific journal—whether emoji, photo, or note—can be updated or deleted individually or collectively. The interfaces for updating and deleting journal entries maintain consistency with the journal creation process. Additionally, the system enhances user engagement by featuring a pop-up window that indicates other users may be experiencing similar feelings on the same day.
### Mood Statistics: 
The Mood Statistics feature in our app provides users with a visual summary of their emotional patterns, using mood emojis as data points. It automatically compiles and displays the frequency of each emoji used in journal entries over a selected period, typically a month. This insight is visually represented through a RecyclerView, where each mood emoji is accompanied by a horizontal progress bar and a percentage, illustrating the proportion of each mood relative to the total entries. Data is sourced in real-time from Firebase, ensuring up-to-date and personalized statistics. By offering a straightforward and engaging way to track emotional trends, the Mood Statistics feature enhances self-awareness and encourages users to reflect on their mental well-being, making it a crucial component of our app's user-centric design.
### Secure Account and Data Management: 
Users can sign up, login to the app to gain access to data and features, which was implemented with Firebase authentication. Only authenticated users that logged in with email and password can access app content. Additionally, data is secure and privacy is addressed. Authenticated users only have access to their own journals. Users will have access to data like how many people shared the same emoji on a day to boost engagement but the data is aggregated and non-identifying for privacy purposes. Another aspect of secure data and privacy practice is that we have included deleting accounts and clearing data as setting options so users have control of what stays within our database and can wipe any personal data by deleting the account or clearing the data.

# Areas went deep:
### Sensor: 
Our app leverages the capabilities of the camera to transform how users record and reflect on their daily experiences. By integrating camera functionalities, users can capture images that visually represent their moods and moments, offering a new and enriched way to journal. We utilize CameraX for handling various camera operations such as previewing, capturing images, and local storage management efficiently and with minimal code. Once a photo is taken, it is seamlessly uploaded to Firebase Storage, ensuring secure and scalable cloud storage. Each image download link is then stored in a specific journal entry, saved in the Firebase Realtime Database, capturing the essence of the user's day. Making the image readily accessible and linked to the appropriate date and user. This allows for a personalized journal page where users can retrieve and view their captured moments along with their written entries, thereby creating a more vivid and interactive journaling experience. This innovative use of the camera not only enhances user engagement by enabling a visually expressive journal but also enhances the archival quality of the memories stored in the app.
### UI: 
Our app has a clear and intuitive UI design. We have user-centric design that intuitively guides users through the app’s features. Users will be guided to sign in or sign up an account for our app first, then they will go to the calendar view page, where users can choose a specific date to write mood journals. When a specific date is chosen, they will be guided to a mood selecting page to select a mood of the day, then users will go to the journal adding page. Users can also click the face button located at the bottom of the calendar view page to add journals. As the calendar view page is our main page, users can also access settings, searching and mood proportional map pages through this page. When a journal is done, users will go back to the calendar view page. Our app mainly uses simple design elements and simple colors to create a relaxing and soft overall style. Besides, we increase user interaction and engagement through daily quote API and the same-mood pop-up window in the journal page. As for security and privacy, users have the control over their privacy settings and personal data (e.g, cleanup all data, delete account). To sum up, our app offers a seamless blend of intuitive design, user privacy, and engaging features like daily quotes and mood-sharing, all within a calming interface. It's a simple, secure tool for emotional tracking and reflection, designed for ease of use and personal growth.
### User Engagement: 
Our app provides users with an interactive overview of their emotional well-being. Users log their daily emotions using emojis, transforming the abstract concept of mood tracking into a colorful, intuitive, and engaging visual diary. This immediate visual feedback makes the process enjoyable and easy to understand, encouraging daily interaction. Users can also personalize their calendar by choosing different emoji sets. This customization enhances the user's connection to the app, making the tracking experience uniquely tailored to their preferences. Users can track daily moods with emojis and view comprehensive statistics that summarize emotional trends over the month. Additionally, the app enhances community connection by querying Firebase Realtime Database to identify and display users who have recorded the same emojis on the same day, fostering a sense of solidarity and understanding. Knowing others share their feelings can validate personal experiences and stimulate further engagement with the app. This feature set not only helps users reflect on their own emotional health but also connects them with a broader community experiencing similar emotions.
